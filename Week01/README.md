### 912A-Tricky Alchemy

[Question](http://codeforces.com/contest/912/problem/A)|[Answer](http://codeforces.com/contest/912/submission/42297123)

Objective of problem 912A-Tricky Alchemy is to find how much yellow and blue crystals Grisha lacks in order to create a specified number 
of christmas balls. She will need a fix amount of 2 yellow crystals, 1 yellow and 1 blue, and 3 blue crystals to create 1 yellow, green 
and blue balls respectively. To solve this problem we need to first find the amount of yellow or blue crystal she lacks, in this case we
find yellow first. The amount of yellow crystal she lacks will be the amount of yellow crystals she has subtracted by the yellow crystals
she needs to create the specified amount of yellow (2 crystals) and green (1 crystal) balls she needed. If the result is a positive number,
then that means that she doesn't lack any yellow crystal. If the result is a negative number, then that is the amount of yellow crystals
that she lacks, or have in excess. Doing the same with the blue crystal, this time blue (3 crystals) and green (1 crystal), will result 
in the amount of blue crystal she lacks. The amount of crystals she lack will be the absolute value of the yellow or blue crystals she
lacks, or in the case where she lacks both will be the sum of the absolute value of yellow and blue crystals.
